## Description
AdvancedBanX MutePreventions is an addon for the plugin [AdvancedBanX](https://github.com/hlpdev/AdvancedBanX). 
The addon prevents muted players from writing and editing the text on signs, and prevents muted players from 
editing the text in writable books. The plugin monitors the SignChangeEvent and PlayerEditBookEvent at the 
monitor level which should ensure compatibility with plugins that use signs such as ChestShops.
